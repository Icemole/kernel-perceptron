% Function by which the Kernel matrix is obtained.
% It should be called "kernel_function", and should have
% the following parameters:
% 
% function result = kernel_function( sample_matrix, sample_1, sample_2 )
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% YOUR FUNCTION HERE
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% Note that sample_1 and sample_2 correspond to numbers
% according to the order in which you typed in the samples,
% so you should properly index them on the samples matrix
% (see right below).
% 
% Define it now so that you do not have to manually
% type in the kernel matrix.
% 
% Example of a multinomial kernel:
% function result = kernel_function( samples, sample_1, sample_2 )
%	result = samples( sample_1, : ) * samples( sample_2, : )';
%	% Take into account that because the samples are stored as rows,
%	% for the scalar product operation to work you will need to
%	% transpose the second sample so that a row vector is multiplied
%	% by a column vector.
% 
%	result += 2;

% - Every row is a sample.
% - Every column is the sample's value on the
% dimension given by the column.
%
% samples = zeros( numSamples, dimensions );
% Define it if you do not want to be asked for it later.


% Class vector. The i-th element corresponds to
% the class to which the i-th sample belongs.
%
% classes = zeros( numSamples, 1 );
% Define it if you do not want to be asked for it later.


% Alpha (learning rate) coefficients. The i-th
% element corresponds to the learning rate of
% the classifier with respect to the i-th sample.
%
% Define it if you do not want to be asked for it later.
